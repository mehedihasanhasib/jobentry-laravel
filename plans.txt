1. Separate controller/views/routes for different modules
	a. controllers structure would be
		app/http/controllers/front
		app/http/controllers/admin
		app/http/controllers/recruiter
	
	b. views structure would be
		resources/views/front
		resources/views/admin
		resources/views/recruiter
		
	c. routes stracture will be
		"routes/web.php" will be for frontend
		"routes/admin.php" will be for admin and will be required in "web.php"
		"routes/recruiter.php" will be for admin and will be required in "web.php"

2. Always use resuseable components or functions.
3. Use Laravel's built-in features.
4. Try to make your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
